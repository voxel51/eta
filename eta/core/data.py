class DataContainer(etas.Container):
    '''Abstract base class for containers that store lists of `Serializable`
    data class instances.

    This class cannot be instantiated directly. Instead a subclass should
    be created for each type of data to be stored. Subclasses MUST set the
    following members:
        -  `_ELE_CLS`: the class of the element stored in the container

    In addition, sublasses MAY override the following members:
        - `_ELE_CLS_FIELD`: the name of the private attribute that will store
            the class of the elements in the container
        - `_ELE_ATTR`: the name of the attribute that will store the elements
            in the container

    DataContainer subclasses embed their class names and underlying data
    instance class names in their JSON representations, so they can be read
    reflectively from disk.

    Examples:
        ```
        from eta.core.data import DataContainer
        from eta.core.geometry import LabeledPointContainer

        tags = LabeledPointContainer(...)
        tags.write_json("tags.json")

        tags2 = DataContainer.from_json("tags.json")
        print(tags2.__class__)  # LabeledPointContainer, not DataContainer
        ```

    Attributes:
        <data>: a list of data instances. The field name <data> is specified by
            the `_ELE_ATTR` member of the DataContainer subclass, and the class
            of the data instances is specified by the `_ELE_CLS` member
    '''

    @property
    def _data(self):
        '''Convenient access to the list of data instances stored independent
        of what the name of that attribute is.
        '''
        return self._elements
