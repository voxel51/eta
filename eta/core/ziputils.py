"""
Utility functions for working with zipped directories of files.

Note that this module is not intended to provide general purpose zip-related
utilities such as zipping and extracting arbitrary files and directories.
For such functionality, see `eta.core.utils`. Rather, this module is
specifically designed to automate the processing of parallel files and
directories that arise when ETA modules support both both single inputs or zip
files containing multiple inputs of the same type.
